I enclosed all 17 flip boxes with a flip-box div to allow all the 17 flip boxes to dynamically rearrange themselves when the size of the window changes. A flex box is a very useful tool for dynamically organized webpages and will likely be applied to my final website.</td>

For example, it can be used to change the text contents in a paragraph tag. </td>

        </td>
        <td>This stage involved using Javascript functions to manipulate the string of data into an integer. This involved using functions and methods such as .substring(), .indexOf(), and .replace(). I then displayed the first few values from the array graphically on the site with bars representing the number of people living with HIV. Some math was necessary to scale the lengths of the bars to the size of the window. In general, this stage involved manipulating and graphically displaying data from the JSON file. These methods and techniques will definitely benefit my development of the final website where data will be graphcially displayed. </td>

        <td>In this stage, I learned how to use for loops in Javascript to display all the integer values in the array graphically. The same functions and math in Stage 4 were applied to each element of the array of data using a for loop and displayed to the screen in a different for loop. The stage also involved using a simple algorithm to find the largest value of the array of integers. Throughout the development of my final site, many repetitive tasks will be necessary and as such using loops is a crucial skill to have. </td>

I used the instance method addEventListener to bind certain actions to certain functions, and created the functions to be called when the user performs an action, such as clicking on the button. Finally, I added the script to use the Clarifai API. This was all done in the external Javascript file. Event-driven programming is necessary to make use of buttons, dropdowns, and other elements so skills from this stage will definitely be applied in my final website. </td>
