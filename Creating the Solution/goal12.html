		<h1> UN Goal #12: Responsible Food Consumption </h1>


		
		<div>

			<h2> Introduction </h2>

			<p> Food is obviously essential for human life. You may be living in a condition where you feel comfortable about how you obtain and consume your food. But did you know that one third of all food produced in the world is wasted, not consumed, according to the United Nations? The 13% of the population not receiving sufficient nourishment (Source: Food Aid Foundation) could theoretically be fed if this food did not go to waste. </p>
			<p> From farms to supermarkets to fridges to plates, there are a lot of steps required to bring food to your table. These are all steps where food can easily go to the dump. The prevention of irresponsible food consumption is a large part of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal #12.  </p>

			<div>
				<p>  The targets below were taken from the UN Sustainable Development Goals website. </p>
				<p> 12.1: Implement the 10-year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production, all countries taking action, with developed countries taking the lead, taking into account the development and capabilities of developing countries. </p>
				<p> 12.2: By 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources. </p>
				<p> 12.3: By 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses. </p>

			<p> As our population continues to grow, the amount of food we as a species requires will continue to grow as well. After all, we cannot simply start lowering the amount of food we eat. We must therefore plan for an ever-increasing demand for food. </p>

			<p> As our demand on food continues to increase, we must dedicate more and more of our resources and our land towards food. Agriculture is very costly, occupying large areas of land, and using large quantities for fertilizer and hydration. However, as we continue to deplete our natural resources and occupy more and more of our land on this planet, it is evident that as something has to change before our production of food is no longer sustainable. </p>

			<p> Obviously, we cannot expect to control the amount of food we as a population put into our mouths. There are then only two things we can change: how we produce food, and how much of our food goes to waste. New food production methods are being researched, but many of the new, more efficient food production methods, such as synthetic protein-based meats, are years, if not decades away from being viable food sources. </p>

			<p> As such, for now, we must be very careful about how we consume food to minimize food waste. </p>
