			<h2> Introduction </h2>

			<p> In the past few centuries, humanity has progressed great lengths in the technology of harnessing and manipulating energy. As our technology continues to advance, and as our population continues to grow, surely we will demand more and more power from our Earth. That raises the very crucial question: how far can we push the Earth, its resources, and its fragile environment? Are we causing unsustainable and irreversable damage to our planet to fuel our energy needs? </p>
			<p> A greater understanding of our planet in recent years have shed light on just how critical this situation is. According to ...... we are causing ... damange and _____. In order to ensure continued sustainable development, change is necessary. </p>
			<p> While it is clearly difficult to reduce our energy demands, we can still make drastic improvements in how we generate and produce the energy. The UN Sustainable Development Goal #7 details targets for improvement of our power generation solutions.</p>

			<h3> UN Description - Goal 7 </h3>

			<div>
				<p> <img class = "floatRight" src="images/07 Affordable and Clean Energy.png" alt="Avatar" style="width:300px; height:300px;"/> These following targets are taken from the official UN Sustainable Development Goals website.</p>
				<p> 7.1: By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services. </p>
				<p> 7.2: By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. </p>
				<p> 7.3: By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency. </p>
				<p> 7.A: By 2030, enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology. </p>
				<p> 7.B: By 2030, expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing States, and land-locked developing countries, in accordance with their respective programmes of support. </p>

			<p> We can see from the data above that the majority of our current energy production is from the combustion of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are carbon-based fuels, made from organic matter undergoing millions of years of intense pressure. Our fossil fuel resources are also being rapidly depleted and it is estimated that fossil fuels must be phased out by year 20xx. While new extraction techniques may last temporarily, the affordability of fossil fuels is bound to increase as the supply dwindles. </p>

			<p> Burning fossil fuels releases pollution in the form of carbon dioxide, which poses many adverse effects to human health. The following data from the World Health Organization shows the pollution (PM2.5) levels, in PPM (Parts per Million), in different regions. PM2.5 refers to the level of particulate matter of 2.5 microns or less in diameter (about one third the diameter of a human hair). In almost all of these regions, the average PM2.5 level already drastically exceeds the established maximum annual safe level (one year of continuous exposure) of 10 PPM as defined by the World Health Organization. In Southern Asia the PM2.5 levels are currently more than six times more than the annual safe limit! In (year), it was estimated that XX million deaths may have been related to dangerous levels of air pollution. </p>

			<p> The emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels also leads to irreversable damage to our planet. Carbon Dioxide, the major pollutant resulting from this combustion, is a strong greenhouse gas.  </p>

			<p> In addition to the unsustainable nature of fossil fuels and the adverse affects of pollutants, we must also keep in mind that our energy demands are only rising. Not only is the world's population growing exponentially, but countries are also developing. On a per-capita basis, a developed country is much more energy-hungry than a developing country. For example, in the United States, xxxxxxx.</p>
