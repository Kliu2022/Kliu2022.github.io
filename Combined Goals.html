			<h1> Making Connections: Our Fragile Planet </h1>

			<h2> Introduction <img class = "floatRight" src="images/aliveearth.jpg" alt="Avatar" style="padding-left: 35px;width:320px; height:320px;"/></h2>

			<p> One key aspect of sustainable development is to ensure the resources we have on this planet will sufficiently fulfill and sustain our demands as a growing population while safeguarding our fragile environment.  Out of the seventeen UN Sustainable Development Goals, Goal #7: Affordable and Clean Energy, and Goal #12: Responsible Production and Consumption, are inter-related and are both closely pertinent to the scarcity of certain resources on Earth and the vulnerability of the Earth's environment. And both goals are of paramount importance and significant urgency: many industries and households (even, and sometimes especially, in developed countries) have not been sufficiently practicing the habits of sustainable production/consumption and taking advantage of existing clean energy sources available for them. This lack of action is jeopardizing the very sustainability of human survival and long-term development. </p>
			<p> Food and energy are arguably the two most important necessities for human survival and development, and they are closely related. These two goals can be looked under the broader scope of the more fundamental, bigger issue of resource depletion and environment degradation on Earth. </p>

		<h2> Making Connections: Energy and Food Production </h2>

		<p> In the Goal 7 page, we looked at energy production solutions and greenhouse gas emissions related with energy production, and on the Goal 12 page, we looked at food waste. Food accounts for around 30 percent of the world's energy needs and as such, 22 percent of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

		 		<p> Drilling for fossil fuels requires large expanses of land. For example, shale oil removal causes severe alteration, displacement and fragmentation of land. Fossil fuel production also requires large areas of land for infrastructure such as pipelines, access roads, processing facilites, etc.. For effective strip mining, whole forests and mountaintops are stripped away to expose underground oil deposits in some cases. </p>

		  		<p> Different methods of food production also requires and damages large areas of land.  Conversion to pasture and cropland for farming is the leading cause of deforestation in the world, according to NASA. In the Amazon region, soy plantations are a leading cause of deforestation, and if this deforestation rate continues, it is estimated by WWF that more than a quarter of the Amazon biome will be destroyed.</p>

			<h2> Why isn't it sustainable? </h2>

			<p> <img class = "floatLeft" src="images/dyingearth.jpg" alt="Avatar" style="width:300px; height:300px;"/>
			Our Earth is fragile. The atmosphere can only be polluted so much before it will be impossible for us to bear the consequences. Only so much land can be brutally destroyed before it becomes impossible for us to grow another tree. The way we are destroying our only home is the opposite of sustainable. </p>
			<p> Scientists and the UN are warning that irreversible damage to the world is imminent if we do not act fast and implement climate control mitigation commitments such as the Paris Agreement. The effects of climate change are already being felt. In 2017, the damage caused by climate change-related disasters hit a record-high $320 Billion USD.</p>
			<p> Similar damage can be felt on our precious and life-giving ecosystems. Due to land usage and pollution, it is estimated that the number of endangered species is currently hundreds, if not thousands of times higher than the background rate. Over the past 500 years, human activity has forced more than 800 species into permanent extinction.</p>

			<h2> What Can We Do? </h2>



			<p> Apparently, it is now critical that we act on these issues.  <p>
