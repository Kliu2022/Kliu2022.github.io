			<div>
				<p> <img class = "floatRight" src="images/07 Affordable and Clean Energy.png" alt="Avatar" style="width:300px; height:300px;"/> These following targets are taken from the official UN Sustainable Development Goals website.</p>
				<p> 7.1: By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services. </p>
				<p> 7.2: By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. </p>
				<p> 7.3: By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency. </p>
				<p> 7.A: By 2030, enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology. </p>
				<p> 7.B: By 2030, expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing States, and land-locked developing countries, in accordance with their respective programmes of support. </p>

			<p> We can see from the data above that the majority of our current energy production is from the combustion of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are carbon-based fuels, made from organic matter undergoing millions of years of intense pressure. Our fossil fuel resources are also being rapidly depleted and it is estimated that fossil fuels must be phased out by year 20xx. While new extraction techniques may last temporarily, the affordability of fossil fuels is bound to increase as the supply dwindles. </p>

			<div class="row">
			
		 	<div class="column1"> 
		 		<img src="images/bj.jpg" alt="Avatar" style="width:100%;"/>

		 		<p> Burning fossil fuels releases pollution in the form of carbon dioxide, which poses many adverse effects to human health. The following data from the World Health Organization shows the pollution (PM2.5) levels, in PPM (Parts per Million). In almost all of these regions, the average PM2.5 level already drastically exceeds the established maximum annual safe level (one year of continuous exposure) of 10 PPM as defined by the World Health Organization. In Southern Asia the PM2.5 levels are currently more than six times more than the annual safe limit! </p>


			  	</div>
			  <div class="column1"> 
	  			<img src="images/gbw.jpg" alt="Avatar" style="width: 100%"/>
		  		<p> The emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels also leads to irreversable damage to our planet. Carbon Dioxide, the major pollutant resulting from this combustion, is a strong greenhouse gas.  </p>


			  	</div>
		  	 <div class="column1"> 
		  		<img src="images/oil.png" alt="Avatar" style="width: 100%"/>
		  		<p> In addition to the unsustainable nature of fossil fuels and the adverse affects of pollutants, we must also keep in mind that our energy demands are only rising. Not only is the world's population growing exponentially, but countries are also developing. On a per-capita basis, a developed country is much more energy-hungry than a developing country. </p>


		  		</div>
			</div>

			<br>

			<p> In conclusion, we must reduce our unsustainable dependance on fossil fuels and shift more towards cleaner energy sources. As individuals, it is required that we start to take action before it is too late. </p>

			<h2> What Can You do? </h2>


			<p> As a reader, you might be thinking how one person can make a difference in this issue. After all, one person is not going to be able to supply the entire country with solar energy. That said, there is still a lot you can do. </p>
			<button class="accordion">If you operate a household</button>
			<div class="panel">
			  
				<h3> Reduce your energy consumption first </h3>
				<p> While relying on clean energy may not immediately be practical for a household or a business, reducing your unnecessary energy consumption will still help reduce carbon emmissions. Below are a few of the most effective ways to reduce the energy footprint of your household or business. </p>
				<p> Energy Efficient Lightbulbs: Switching to energy-efficient lightbulbs such as LED lightbulbs reduces your power use and saves you money on your power bill!</p>
				<p> Hybrid or electric vehicles: Hybrid and electric vehicles still provide the same convenience of driving to your desination, without the nasty carbon footprint. </p>
				<p> Energy-efficient Appliances: Consider using energy-saving features on appliances and purchasing energy-efficient devices. This can end up saving you a lot of money! </p>
				<h3> Consider installing solar panels for your home </h3>
				<p> Environmentally friendly and economically smart, solar panels are a great and accessible renewable energy source that can power your home or business without emitting any pollution at all. A single 5.5ft by 3ft solar panel can power 80 LED lightbulbs for four hours a day, according to www.solarpanelrocks.com.</p>

				<h3> Advocate clean energy sources to your community</h3>
				<p> Consider writing to your government about the importance of clean energy, or organizing events in your community to advocate the cause. One person's initiative can do a lot! </p>

				<p> Let your employers know about these issues! Large businesses can be very power hungry, which means there can be a lot of energy to save. Switching to a renewable energy source can also fit many businesses very well. </p>
