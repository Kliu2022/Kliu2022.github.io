			<p> 12.1: Implement the 10-year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production, all countries taking action, with developed countries taking the lead, taking into account the development and capabilities of developing countries. </p>
			<p> 12.2: By 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources. </p>
			<p> 12.3: By 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses. </p>

			<h2> Why Isn't It Sustainable? </h2>
			<div class = "shortline"><hr></div>

			<p> As our population continues to grow, the amount of food we as a species requires will continue to increase as well. After all, we cannot simply start lowering the amount of food we eat. We must therefore plan for an ever-increasing demand for food. </p><br>

		 		<h3> Increasing food output is not always feasable... </h3>
		 		<img src="images/nofarm.jpg" alt="Avatar" style="width:100%;"/>

		 		<p> As our demand on food continues to increase, we must dedicate more and more of our resources and our land towards food. Agriculture is very costly, occupying large areas of land, and using large quantities for fertilizer and hydration. However, as we continue to deplete our natural resources and occupy more and more of our land on this planet, it is evident that something has to change before our production of food is no longer sustainable. </p>


			  </div>
			  <div class="column2"> 

			  		<h3>... but conservation is. </h3>
			  		<img src="images/conserv.jpg" alt="Avatar" style="width: 100%"/>
			  		<p> Obviously, we cannot expect to control the amount of food we as a population put into our mouths. There are then only two things we can change: how we produce food, and how much of our food goes to waste. New food production methods are being researched, but many of the new, more efficient food production methods, such as synthetic protein-based meats, are years, if not decades away from being viable food sources. As such, for now, the only sustainable way is to conserve and minimize food waste. </p>
