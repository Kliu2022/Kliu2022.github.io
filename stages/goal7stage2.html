		<h1> UN Goal #7: Affordable and Clean Energy </h1>
	</div>

		
		<div>

			<h2> Introduction </h2>

			<p> In the past few centuries, humanity has progressed great lengths in the technology of harnessing and manipulating energy. As our technology continues to advance, and as our population continues to grow, surely we will demand more and more power from our Earth. That raises the very crucial question: how far can we push the Earth, its resources, and its fragile environment? Are we causing unsustainable and irreversable damage to our planet to fuel our energy needs? </p>
			<p> A greater understanding of our planet in recent years have shed light on just how critical this situation is. According to ...... we are causing ... damange and _____. In order to ensure continued sustainable development, change is necessary. </p>
			<p> While it is clearly difficult to reduce our energy demands, we can still make drastic improvements in how we generate and produce the energy. The UN Sustainable Development Goal #7 details targets for improvement of our power generation solutions.</p>

			<h3> UN Description - Goal 7 </h3>

			<div>
				<p> <img class = "floatRight" src="images/07 Affordable and Clean Energy.png" alt="Avatar" style="width:300px; height:300px;"/> These following targets are taken from the official UN Sustainable Development Goals website.</p>
				<p> 7.1: By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services. </p>
				<p> 7.2: By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. </p>
				<p> 7.3: By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency. </p>
				<p> 7.A: By 2030, enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology. </p>
				<p> 7.B: By 2030, expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing States, and land-locked developing countries, in accordance with their respective programmes of support. </p>

			<p> We can see from the data above that the majority of our current energy production is from the combustion of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are carbon-based fuels, made from organic matter undergoing millions of years of intense pressure. Our fossil fuel resources are also being rapidly depleted and it is estimated that fossil fuels must be phased out by year 20xx. While new extraction techniques may last temporarily, the affordability of fossil fuels is bound to increase as the supply dwindles. </p>

			<p> Burning fossil fuels releases pollution in the form of carbon dioxide, which poses many adverse effects to human health. The following data from the World Health Organization shows the pollution (PM2.5) levels, in PPM (Parts per Million), in different regions. PM2.5 refers to the level of particulate matter of 2.5 microns or less in diameter (about one third the diameter of a human hair). In almost all of these regions, the average PM2.5 level already drastically exceeds the established maximum annual safe level (one year of continuous exposure) of 10 PPM as defined by the World Health Organization. In Southern Asia the PM2.5 levels are currently more than six times more than the annual safe limit! In (year), it was estimated that XX million deaths may have been related to dangerous levels of air pollution. </p>

			<p> The emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels also leads to irreversable damage to our planet. Carbon Dioxide, the major pollutant resulting from this combustion, is a strong greenhouse gas.  </p>

			<p> In addition to the unsustainable nature of fossil fuels and the adverse affects of pollutants, we must also keep in mind that our energy demands are only rising. Not only is the world's population growing exponentially, but countries are also developing. On a per-capita basis, a developed country is much more energy-hungry than a developing country. For example, in the United States, xxxxxxx.</p>

			<p> In conclusion, we must reduce our unsustainable dependance on fossil fuels and shift more towards cleaner energy sources. As individuals, it is required that we start to take action before it is too late. </p>

			<h2> What Can You do? </h2>

			<p> As a reader, you might be thinking how one person can make a difference in this issue. After all, one person is not going to be able to supply the entire country with solar energy. That said, there is still a lot you can do. <p>

			<h3> Reduce your energy consumption first </h3>
			<p> While relying on clean energy may not immediately be practical for a household or a business, reducing your unnecessary energy consumption will still help reduce carbon emmissions. Below are a few of the most effective ways to reduce the energy footprint of your household or business. </p>
			<p> Energy Efficient Lightbulbs: Switching to energy-efficient lightbulbs such as LED lightbulbs reduces your power use and saves you money on your power bill!</p>
			<p> Hybrid or electric vehicles: Hybrid and electric vehicles still provide the same convenience of driving to your desination, without the nasty carbon footprint. </p>
			<p> Energy-efficient Appliances: Consider using energy-saving features on appliances and purchasing energy-efficient devices. This can end up saving you a lot of money! </p>


			<h3> Consider installing solar panels for your home or business </h3>
			<p> Environmentally friendly and economically smart, solar panels are a great and accessible renewable energy source that can power your home or business without emitting any pollution at all. </p>
			<h3> Advocate clean energy sources to your community</h3>
			<p> Consider writing to your government about the importance of clean energy, or organizing events in your community to advocate the cause. One person's initiative can do a lot! </p>
			<h3> Advocate clean energy to your business </h3>
			<p> Let your employers know about these issues! Large businesses can be very power hungry, which means there can be a lot of energy to save. Switching to a renewable energy source can also fit many businesses very well. </p>
